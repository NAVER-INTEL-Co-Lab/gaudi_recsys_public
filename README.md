## Gaudi-v2: For recommendation models

This repository is designed for implementing and testing recommendation models using Gaudi-v2.

We demonstrate our implementation of recommendation models, focusing on integrating multimodal inputs and utilizing Intel Gaudi-v2 devices for efficient computation. The primary goal of this repository is to provide the following contributions:

1. Implementaion of Traditional Recommendation Models
    - Models such as Matrix Factorization (MF) and SASRec have been implemented and optimized for training within the Gaudi-v2 environment.
2. Development of an LLM-based Recommendation Model
    - We have implemented LLM-based recommendation models, called TALLRec, LLaRA, CoLLM, and A-LLMRec using Gaudi-v2.
3. Exploration of MLLM-based Recommendation
    - By leveraging Gaudi-v2, we aim to integrate multimodal data (e.g., visual, audio) to enhance item representations beyond text-based features. This exploration provides insights into improving recommendation performance through multimodal learning.
4. Issue Identification
    - While implementing and training these models on Gaudi-v2, we identified several challenges related to the Gaudi-v2
        - About `nn.Embedding` [Issue](https://github.com/NAVER-INTEL-Co-Lab/gaudi_recsys_public/tree/master/SASRec-gaudi).
        - About `LoRA` [Link](https://github.com/NAVER-INTEL-Co-Lab/gaudi_recsys_public/blob/master/On_Going_for_Gaudi/bit_load_error.ipynb)
        
            Huggingface doesnâ€™t support 8-bit operations on Gaudi-v2 
        - About `save_pretrained` of Huggingface [Link](https://github.com/NAVER-INTEL-Co-Lab/gaudi_recsys_public/blob/master/On_Going_for_Gaudi/bit_load_error.ipynb)

            Gaudi-v2 raises an error if model weights are not converted to CPU before saving.
